  ```
  "Flag only muscle artifacts, ignore cardiac artifacts"
  "Prioritize brain components in alpha band analysis"
  "Conservative artifact rejection for clinical data"
  ```

# Initialize AutoClean Vision
acv = AutoCleanVision(confidence_threshold=0.8)

# Integrate with existing MNE workflow
raw = mne.io.read_raw_edf('data.edf')
ica = mne.preprocessing.ICA()
ica.fit(raw)

# Vision-based component classification
classifications = acv.classify_ica_components(ica, raw)
brain_components = [i for i, cls in enumerate(classifications) if cls.label == 'brain']
ica.exclude = [i for i in range(len(classifications)) if i not in brain_components]
```
