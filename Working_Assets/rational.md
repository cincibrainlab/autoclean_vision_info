A **vision-enabled EEG artifact suite** (e.g., "Autoclean Vision") is an integrated software platform that uses advanced computer vision models—such as CNNs or Vision Transformers—to automatically detect and annotate artifacts in EEG recordings by analyzing visual representations of the data. Instead of relying solely on traditional signal processing or statistical features, the suite converts multi-channel EEG signals into informative images (such as time–frequency spectrograms, topographic maps, or stacked signal plots). These images are processed by AI agents trained to recognize the distinct visual signatures of common artifacts (e.g., eye blinks, muscle noise, electrode pops).

**Key features**:

* Fully automated, high-throughput artifact detection using visual deep learning.
* Modular architecture supporting plug-in AI agents for specialized artifact types.
* Human-in-the-loop interface for expert review, rapid correction, and iterative training.
* Prompt-guided workflows: users can specify priorities (e.g., “flag only muscle artifacts,” “ignore cardiac artifacts”) using natural language.
* Detailed visual outputs: heatmaps or highlights show exactly where artifacts are detected on the EEG image, making expert review transparent and efficient.
* Active learning capabilities: model performance continually improves as experts validate or correct automated annotations.

**Autoclean Vision** aims to outperform conventional pipelines by leveraging visual pattern recognition, improving speed, consistency, and accuracy, while retaining full expert oversight and control. It bridges the gap between traditional EEG cleaning and modern human–AI collaboration.
