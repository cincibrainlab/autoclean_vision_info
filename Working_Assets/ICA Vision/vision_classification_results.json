        "reason": "The decisive feature is the power spectrum, which shows a clear and sustained positive slope: power increases with increasing frequency from around 20-30Hz upwards, curving upwards at higher frequencies. This is the hallmark of muscle artifact. The topography also supports this, showing a localized 'bowtie' pattern near the edge of the scalp (right temporal/posterior region), which is common for muscle components. The time series is somewhat erratic and high-frequency, further supporting this classification. There is no evidence of a 1/f brain-like spectrum, no sharp QRS-like spikes (heart), no tightly focused frontal dipole (eye), and no single-electrode focality (channel noise). The 60Hz notch is a normal filtering artifact and not indicative of line noise. Therefore, this component is best classified as 'muscle'.",
